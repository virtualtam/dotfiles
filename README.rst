ZOMG, dotfiles!
===============

What's in there for me?
-----------------------

Hello, fellow GitHub wanderer!

These are my dotfiles, some of them having survived and mutated through years
spent editing stuff from the command-line ;-)

They're revolving around the following elements:

* `solarized`_ dark color theme
* `rxvt-unicode`_ terminal emulator
* `tmux`_ terminal multiplexer
* `bash`_, the good ol' shell
* `emacs`_ text editor (and many other things)
* `moc`_ player
* `mcabber`_ XMPP client
* `git`_ and `mercurial`_ distributed SCMs
* some extra stuff
